// TAC Life Support patch for SDHI Service Module System
// Author: Robin "sumghai" Chang
// Revision: 1.1

// This modifies the Service Module and the stock Mark 1-2 Pod so that the combined Command/Service Module stack provides a total of eight (8) Kerbin days' worth[1]
// of life support crew provisions for its three-Kerbal crew, in contrast to the TAC Life Support default[2] of four (4) Kerbin days.
//
// Based on known specifications and features of the real-life NASA Orion MPCV Service Module[3], the SDHI SM will provide an extra four days' worth of Water and Oxygen,
// the equivalent in WasteWater and CarbonDioxide storage, and built-in Carbon Extractors / Water Purifiers. Meanwhile, the Mark 1-2 Pod will hold the extra four days
// of Food and Waste storage, since Food and solid fecal matter can't be transferred to/from the Pod/SM via any realistic umbilical system.
//
// The Avionics Ring alternative to the standard SDHI SM will only be equipped with the Carbon Extractor and Water Purifier, as there is no conceivable space to fit 
// the added storage capacity for Water/Oxygen/WasteWater/CarbonDioxide.
//
// Both parts will also be fitted with a Fuel Cell assembly to convert LiquidFuel and Oxidizer to ElectricCharge, as a backup electricity generator
//
// [1] 1 Kerbin day = 6 Earth hours
// [2] 1 unit of any TAC Life Support resource lasts for four Kerbin days per Kerbal
// [3] In reality, the baseline NASA Orion Service Module can provide up to 21 human days of provisions for four human astronauts; the SDHI SM is less capable because
//     I don't want to make it overpowered :P


// Modifies the stock Mark 1-2 Pod to give a total of eight Kerbal days of Food and its equivalent in Waste storage for the three-Kerbal crew
