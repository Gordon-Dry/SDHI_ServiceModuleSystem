// TAC Life Support patch for SDHI Service Module System
// Author: Robin "sumghai" Chang
// Revision: 2.0
//
// For use with TAC-LS 0.9 pre-release and later versions

// This modifies the Service Module and the stock Mark 1-2 Pod so that the combined Command/Service Module stack provides a total of eight (8) Kerbin days' worth[1]
// of life support crew provisions for its three-Kerbal crew, in contrast to the TAC Life Support default of three (3) Kerbin days.
//
// Eight days' of provisions allow the combined CSM spacecraft to operate indepedently for one week (seven days), plus one extra day as a emergency reserve.
//
// Based on known specifications and features of the real-life NASA Orion MPCV Service Module[2], the SDHI SM will provide an extra five days' worth of Water and Oxygen,
// the equivalent in WasteWater and CarbonDioxide storage, and built-in Carbon Extractors / Water Purifiers. Meanwhile, the Mark 1-2 Pod itself will hold the additional
// five days of Food and Waste storage on top of the default three days, since Food and solid fecal matter can't be transferred to/from the Pod/SM via any realistic
// umbilical system.
//
// The Avionics Ring alternative to the standard SDHI SM will only be equipped with the Carbon Extractor and Water Purifier, as there is no conceivable space to fit 
// the added storage capacity for Water/Oxygen/WasteWater/CarbonDioxide.
//
// [1] 1 Kerbin day = 6 Earth hours
// [2] In reality, the baseline NASA Orion Service Module can provide up to 21 human days of provisions for four human astronauts; the SDHI SM is less capable because
//     I don't want to make it overpowered :P
//
// NOTE: All numbers have been rounded up to 1 decimal place, as that is the precision of the KSP tweakables system


// Modifies the stock Mark 1-2 Pod to give, for its three-Kerbal crew, a total of:
// - eight Kerbal days of Food
// - three Kerbal days of Water
// - three Kerbal days of Oxygen
// - three Kerbal days of CarbonDioxide storage
// - eight Kerbal days of Waste storage
// - three Kerbal days of WasteWater storage
