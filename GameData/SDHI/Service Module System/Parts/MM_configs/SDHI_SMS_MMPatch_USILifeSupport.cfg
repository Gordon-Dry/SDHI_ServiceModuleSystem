// USI Life Support patch for SDHI Service Module System
// Author: Robin "sumghai" Chang
// Revision: 1.0
//
// For use with USI LS v0.5.0 and above

// This modifies the stock Mark 1-2 Pod so that the combined Command/Service Module stack provides a total of eight (8) Kerbin days' worth[1]
// of life support crew provisions for its three-Kerbal crew. This capability is equivalent to that specified for TAC-LS.
//
// As the USI LS Supplies, Mulch and Fertilizer resources are considered solids, they cannot be stored in or transferred to/from the Service Module
// or Avionics Ring via any realistic umbilical system. Also, the short duration of the mission means no Recyclers, Greenhouses or Fertilizer are needed.
//
// Eight days' of provisions allow the combined CSM spacecraft to operate indepedently for one week (seven days), plus one extra day as a emergency reserve.
//
// [1] 1 Kerbin day = 6 Earth hours
//


// Modifies the stock Mark 1-2 Pod to give, for its three-Kerbal crew, a total of:
// - eight Kerbal days of Supplies
// - eight Kerbal days of Mulch storage
